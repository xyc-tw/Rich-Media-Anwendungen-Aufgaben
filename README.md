Simple text editor with HTML.

Program a simple text editor using HTML input elements and selection boxes.

The editor should allow the user to enter text, as in the last example of this learning unit. 

In addition, the font size can be adjusted using a slider (input of the range type). Font, font weight and font style should be changeable using selection boxes. The font color should also be able to be set dynamically using a color picker (input of type color).

The form elements of type <input> and <select> are already created in the body of the template file THJ ESA Template.html (1.53 KB).

In addition, some JavaScript code is provided. Further information on implementing the missing functionalities can be found in the comments in the program code.
